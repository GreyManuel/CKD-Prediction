Columns with problem:
1. rbc
    - A lot of null records.
    - It is catagorical column.
2. rc and wc
    - A lot of null records.
3. sod and pot
    - Some null records.
    - slightly related column
4. cad, appet, pe and ane
    - unbalanced data(catagories are unbalanced)
5. ba, appet and dm
    - unrelated or slightly related column

Solution for columns with problem:
1. rbc
    - drop rbc since it has a lot of null records and at the same time, it is catagorical column. And the catagories are also unbalanced
2. rc and wc
    - They had a very good correlation but since they have a lot of null records, we have to drop them.
3. cad, sod, pot appet, ba, appet, dm, pe and ane
    - Drop them
4. Drop rows which have any null record.

Some features to be added:
1. bp/age (blood pressure per age)
2. bgr/su (blood glucose random per sugar)
3. bu/al (blood urea per albumin)


High correlations:
1. hemo & sg - 70%
2. pcv & sg - 69%
3. hemo & pcv - 89%
4. bu & sc - 64%
5. al & bu - 57%
6. su & bgr - 72%

catagorical-textual columns:
1. pc - ordinal
2. htn - ordinal

--> All catagorical-textual attributes are ordinal.. so, we will use Label encoding

--> We will scale all numerical attributes
